### Generate complete Reports from your Concept Maps ###
Export the rich information of your Concept Maps as [PDF](http://instrumind.blob.core.windows.net/imtc-samples/Basic_ATM_Processing.pdf)/ [XPS](http://instrumind.blob.core.windows.net/imtc-samples/Basic_ATM_Processing.xps) documents.
Plus, generate [HTML Reports](http://instrumind.blob.core.windows.net/imtc-samples/Basic_ATM_Processing.HTML.zip) which can be easily published in your website!

### Create composite Concept Maps ###
Each Concept Map symbol or connector can have a whole new Concept Map within it.
So, they can span multiple nested levels and be referenced with shortcuts.

### Visualize basic and extended information ###
Objects can include title+subtitle, pictogram, markers, plus hanging details.
Example of a food product visually represented, plus a couple of simple details:

### Show/hide and format the relevant details ###
Objects can be further detailed with attachments, links and tables.
Example of a beverage visually described, including precise details in a table:

## Features ##

### Create, expose and navigate multiple levels of interconnected knowledge

*   **Composability**: Diagrams are Multilevel, not flat. Each Idea (Concept or Relationship) can have a whole nested diagram within.
*   **Expressive Ideas**: (Concepts or Relationships) can have Name/Title, Summary, Pictogram (representative image), a rich-text Description and Versioning information. Plus, you can give a distinctive visual style to them.
*   **Powerful Relationships**: Relationships can link from/to Concept, other Relationships or themselves, with multiple origins and targets, implement predefined Link-Roles with variable connectors and have differentiated visual styles.
*   **Shortcuts**: Reuse Ideas, on different diagram Views, by referencing them through shortcuts instead of duplication.
*   **Markers**: Tag your ideas with descriptive Markers.
*   **Reports**: Generate descriptive reports about your Compositions.
*   **Complements**: Include legends, information-cards, callouts, notes, stamps, images, titles and group regions (boundaries).
*   **File/Code Generation:**: Extract your Ideas information into output code/files (XML, TXT, or your own custom format).

### Easily include detailed, graphic, descriptive and structured information

*   **Attachments**: Append images, text other types of files relevant to each Idea.
*   **Links**: Reference an external file, folder or web page.
*   **Tables**: Save precise and structured records (data-type based).
*   **Custom-Fields**: Extend your Ideas with personalized information fields.
*   **Import**: Populate your tables from external files (tsv and csv).
*   **Designations**: Give a proper name and describe the intended use of populated details.
*   **Composite Content**: Alternatively, you can show the composite content (internal diagram View) in the Details Posters.

### Define your custom business/field Domains for specialized requirements

*   **Domains**: Define your own Business Domains or Fields of Knowledge.
*   **Concepts and Relationships customization**: Define your specialized types of Concept and Relationships.
*   **Linking Constraints**: Control the types of Ideas which are linkable from/to others.
*   **Link-Role Variants**: Determine available variants for link-roles (eg.: multiplicity/cardinality, connection kindsâ€¦).
*   **Predefined Markers**: Create your own, well described, marker types.
*   **Predefined Details**: Declare details that Ideas will have, including structure (for Tables).
*   **Stock Data**: Pre-store information about your domain (eg.: Currencies, Units of Measure, Product Codes/Familiesâ€¦)
*   **Output-Templates**: Define output-templates (using Liquid markup) for generate text files/code with precise syntax.
